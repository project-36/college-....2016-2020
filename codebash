Write a program to translate an english sentence in to pig latin. Pig latin is a language game of alterations played in english. The purpose is to obfuscate the language. It is a form of encoding. You can learn more about it on wikipedia. However, for the purpose of this exercise, the rules of translation are changed slightly and are as follows:
a) Each word of the sentence is to be translated
b) If the word starts with a vowel, then add ‘ay’ to the end of the word
c) If the word starts with a consonant, then move it to the end of the word and add ‘ay’

INPUT:

    First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
    Each test case will have a single string S

OUTPUT:

    For each test case, output a single result string.

SAMPLE INPUT

2
apple is not red
The sky is blue

SAMPLE OUTPUT

appleay isay otnay edray
heTay kysay isay luebay



code:
n=int(input())
for z in range(n):
    s=str(input()).split(' ')
  
    for k in range(len(s)):
        i = s[k]

        
        if i[0] in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u','A','E','I','O','U']:
            s[k] = i+'ay'
        else:
            s[k]=i[1:]+i[0]+'ay'
    print(' '.join(s))
    s.clear()
2.Phonetic Alphabet
Max. Marks: 40

Write a program that will convert a text string into ‘phonetic alphabet’ and back. The phonetic
alphabet is used when spelling words out. The list below is the standard NATO phonetic alphabet for
English. Any numbers should be printed out as words. The first input to the program will be either
‘english’ or ‘phonetic’ to indicate whether the following text is in english or in phonetic alphabet. The
conversion should happen accordingly


Example: PYTHON 27 ----> Papa Yankee Tango Hotel Oscar November Two Seven}

INPUT:

    First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
    Each test case will have 2 lines. The first line will be used to indicate whether the input is in english or phonetic alphabet.
    The second line will contain the string S to be converted.

OUTPUT:

    For each test case, output a single result string.

 

* The spellings of the phonetic alphabet should be exactly the same as the list in the question. ie. The first letter of each word should be capitalized.
* Only numbers and alphabets will be used in test cases. No special characters.
* Note that, in English, only the frst letter is capital and in Phonetics, the first letter of each word is capitalized.

		l.clear()
